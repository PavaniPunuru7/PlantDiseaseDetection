🌱 Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture  
This project uses deep learning to detect plant diseases from leaf images, helping farmers take timely and accurate actions. Built with a Streamlit web interface, this system enables quick, accessible, and user-friendly diagnosis for real-world agricultural use.

🚀 Features
🌿 Detects plant diseases from uploaded leaf images

🧠 Powered by a pre-trained deep learning model (CNN)

🌍 Designed for sustainable agriculture and improved crop yield

⚡ Real-time predictions using Streamlit UI

📊 Displays confidence score and predictions instantly

🧪 Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras – for deep learning model

Streamlit – for building interactive web UI

OpenCV / PIL – for image handling

Matplotlib / Seaborn – for optional visualization
